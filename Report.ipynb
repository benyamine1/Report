    "In this project, I will try to determine an ideal location for stakeholders interested in opening an Italian restaurant in New York Cityâ€™s Manhattan neighborhood. To find the best locations for stakeholders, I will look for locations where there aren't many restaurants in the area particularly Italian and divide the neighborhoods based on the criteria where the final locations will be selected. The neighborhoods with the lowest number of Italian restaurants are the ideal locations.\n"

    "We have identified the best and worst locations to open an Italian restaurant. The worst locations are neighborhoods like Upper East Side and Greenwich Village with more than eight restaurants.  The most optimal locations are Chinatown, Flatiron, Hamilton Heights, Lower East Side, Manhattan Valley, Tudor City, Washington Heights since they have less than two restaurants. \n"

    "Seven neighborhoods were identified as the best locations for opening Italian restaurants. These locations are only to be used as a starting point for more research. Stakeholders will consider other factors to narrow down their options. \n"
